In a pressure cooker, cook the chana dal for 6 to 7 whistles. The dal has to be cooked well. If you soak the chana dal, the cooking time will be reduced. Once the pressure settles down on its own, strain the cooked dal. The dal has to be strained well.
Keep the stock aside. This stock can be used for making katachi amti which is a thin tempered dal or you can just add it to your veggie dishes or roti.
Heat ghee in a pan and add the ground ginger powder, ground nutmeg powder, ground cardamom powder and ground fennel powder. Fry for a few seconds on a low heat.
Add the chana dal and jaggery. Stir and let this puran mixture cook on a low flame till the mixture becomes dry.
Keep on stirring the puran mixture at intervals.
Once the puran stuffing become dry and thick, switch off the flame.
Let it cool and then mash the puran mixture with a potato masher. You can also use your mixer to mash the puran mixture very well. Keep aside.
